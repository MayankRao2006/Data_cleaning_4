This project focuses on cleaning messy sales data and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python. The goal was to transform raw, inconsistent data into meaningful insights and visualizations.

📂 Project Overview

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, inconsistent entries, duplicates, and formatting issues.

Exploratory Analysis: Analyzed customer, product, and sales patterns using pandas and matplotlib.

Visualizations: Created bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and line graphs to better understand sales distribution and revenue trends.

🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used

Python

Pandas for data cleaning & analysis

Matplotlib for visualization

NumPy for numerical operations

📊 Key Insights (examples)

Which sales channel generated the highest revenue

Top products by sales volume

Sales and revenue trends over time

Customer purchase behavior patterns

🚀 How to Run

Clone this repository:

cd your-repo-name


Install required libraries:

pip install pandas matplotlib numpy


Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to view the analysis.

🙌 A Note on Learning

This project is part of my self-learning journey in Python and data analysis. I referred to documentation, tutorials, and AI guidance to understand and debug concepts, but every line of code and visualization was implemented by me to gain hands-on experience.

✨ Open to feedback, suggestions, and collaboration!
